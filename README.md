# Real_Time_Emotion_Detection

Here, to perform emotion detection on live camera feed I have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network and trained the network on fer2013 dataset hosted by Kaggle.
Achieved 65%(top 10 percentile accuracy) on validation dataset .
Then the saved model was used to predict the emotion from webcamera input using OpenCV.
